## AWS Well-Architected Framework

It helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.

The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars:
- **Operational Excellence**:
  - Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
  - Design principle of performing operations as code
- **Security**: ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
- **Reliability**: ability of a system to
  - Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
  - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
  - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- **Performance Efficiency**: ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
- **Cost Optimization**: ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
- **Sustainability**: ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
