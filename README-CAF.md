### Transformation Phases

The AWS CAF recommends four iterative and incremental cloud transformation phases:

**Align**: to identify capability gaps across the six AWS CAF perspectives, identifying cross-organizational dependencies, and surfacing stakeholder concerns and challenges.

**Envision**: to identify measurable business outcomes that will help the business progress during the transformation journey.

**Launch**: to delivering pilots in production and demonstrating incremental business value rather than identifying capability gaps.

**Scale**: to expand pilots and business value to the desired scale of your company, as well as ensuring the realization and sustainability of cloud-related business benefits.
