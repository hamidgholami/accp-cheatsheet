### Amazon S3
- **CRR** (Cross-region replication): enables automatic, asynchronous
copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.
- You cannot reserve capacity.
- Bucket names rules:
	- Names must be unique across all of AWS.
	- Names must be 3 to 63 characters in length.
	- Names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.
	- Names cannot be formatted as an IP address.
- IAM policies can be written to grant access to Amazon S3 buckets.
- Amazon S3 storage tier:
	- **S3 Standard** -> 99.99% SLA -> for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
	- **S3 Standard-IA** -> 99.9% SLA -> offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard.
	- **S3 One Zone-IA** -> 99% SLA -> *the most cost-effective* Amazon S3 storage tier for data that is not often accessed but requires high durability and it stores data in a **single** AZ.
	- **Glacier** -> No SLA.
- **Multipart upload** can be used to speed up uploads to S3.
- **S3 Copy** -> up to 5GB in size in a single atomic operation.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** is an appropriate Amazon S3 storage class for "data with unknown/changing access pattern".
- **Data consistency** models available are:
	- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects.
	- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (it takes time to propagate).
- "**MFA delete**" adds a layer of additional security to prevent accidental deletion.
- Amazon S3 **objects** consist of:
	- Key
	- Value
	- Version ID
	- Metadata
- **Object lifecycle management** can be used with objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle. Objects can be transitioned to another storage class or expired. It enables you to **set rules** to **automatically transfer** objects between different storage classes at defined time intervals.
- **Standard-IA** and **One Zone-IA** both have a minimum storage duration charge of **30** days

### Six advantages of Amazon Cloud (Benefits)
- Trade capital expense for variable expense.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale.
- Stop guessing about capacity.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres.
- Go global in minutes.

### AWS Compute Optimizer
It helps avoid overprovisioning and underprovisioning, based on your utilization data, four types of AWS resources:
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance types.
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes.
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) services on AWS Fargate.
- AWS Lambda functions.

### Amazon EBS volumes types
- **General purpose (gp2)**(SSD)
	- it provides a good balance of price to performance, is suitable for most workloads and can be used as a system boot volume.
- **Provisioned IOPS (io1)**(SSD)
	- it is a high-performance volume type that is more expensive and should be used for apps that require the higher performance.
- **Cold HDD (sc1)**
	- it cannot be used as a boot volume and is good for throughput oriented storage for infrequently accessed data.
- **Throughput Optimized (st1)**
	- it is ideal for streaming workloads with fast throughput such as big data and data warehouses.

### Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- It distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.
- It offers multiple types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling and robust security, necessary to make your applications fault-tolerant.
- ELB Health Check gets first insights about potential issues.
- A **listener** is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure.
- Each listener has a default **rule**.
- Each rule **action** has a type.
- There are two types of **rule condition**:
	- Host
	- Path
- The primary **benefits** of using AWS ELB:
	- High availability
	- Elasticity

### Amazon Load Balancers
- Application Load Balancers (ALB)
	- process traffic at the HTTP, HTTPS level (layer 7)
	- routes traffic to targets within Amazon VPC
- Network Load Balancers (NLB)
	- process traffic at the TCP, UDP, TLS level (layer 4)
   	- capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies
- Gateway Load Balancers (GLB)
	- handle millions of requests per second, volatile traffic patterns, and introduces extremely low latency
- Classic Load Balancers (CLB)
	- process traffic at the TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS levels (layer 4 & 7).

- *Load balancing with session affinity* can be used for **horizontal scaling** of **stateful** components.

### AWS Internet Gateway
- Do not have `allow` or `deny` rules
- It allows public traffic to access VPC resources
- It operates on VPC level

### AWS Scalability

- "**Compute Hardware**" and "**Data Center Security**" should be included in a TCO analysis comparing on-premise to AWS Cloud.

### Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- [EBS volumes types](#amazon-ebs-volumes-types)
- The **easiest** way to store a backup of an EBS volume on Amazon S3: Create a **snapshot** of the volume.
- Amazon EBS snapshots are stored on *S3*.
- EBS volumes must be **in the same AZ** as the instances they are attached to.
- You can use *Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager* (**Amazon DLM**) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots taken to back up your Amazon EBS volumes.
- The Fundamental *charges* for EBS volumes are:
	- the amount of data **provisioned** (**not** *consumed*) *per* <ins>month</ins>.
	- amount you provision in **IOPS**
- The **root** EBS volumes are **deleted** on termination by <ins>default</ins>.

- You are also not charged for what you use, <ins>IAM is free to use</ins>.
- You can share access to your AWS account.
- Identity federation.
- PCI DSS compliance.
- AWS recommended **best practices**:
	- Create individual IAM users
	- Least privilege principle: granting only the permissions that are needed to perform specific tasks
- IAM **supported authentication** methods include:
	- Console passwords
	- Access keys
	- Server certificates
- Best practice to ensure the security of AWS account
	- **Don’t generate** an access key for the **root account** user
	- Use **Temporary Security Credentials** (IAM Roles) Instead of Long-Term Access Keys
	- Manage IAM User Access Keys Properly
- You can enable single sign-on (**SSO**) to your AWS accounts by using **federation** and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
- All you can do with an **access key** once it has been generated is to:
	- Make active
	- Make inactive
	- Delete
- IAM Policy Simulator evaluates the policies that you choose and determines the effective permissions for each of the actions that you specify.

### Amazon Cognito
- Amazon Cognito Identity Pool provides temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data specific to your account.
- Amazon Cognito User Pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. It doesn't enable access to unauthenticated identities. You have to use an Identity Pool instead.

### AWS Organizations
- **One bill provided** per AWS organization
- Best practices:
	-  Always enable **multi-factor** authentication (MFA) on the root account
	-  Always use a **strong and complex password** on the root account
	-  The **Paying account** should be used for **billing purposes only**. Do not deploy resources into the Paying account
-  With below options organizations can **reduce their cost**:
	-  "Create an AWS Organization configuration linking the accounts"
	-  "Setup consolidated billing between the accounts"
- Volume pricing discounts applied **across multiple accounts**.

### Popular HTTP code

- A HTTP 400 codes: client error
- A HTTP 500 codes: server error

### AWS CloudTrail

	- The time of the API call.
	- The source IP address of the API caller.
	- The request parameters.
	- The response elements returned by the AWS service.

### Amazon CloudWatch

### Amazon DynamoDB
- It's a fully managed **NoSQL** database service. (schema-less)
- You can scale the DB at any time **without incurring downtime**.
- DaynamoDB pricing models:
	- **On-demand capacity mode**: charges you for the data reads and writes your application
	- **Provisioned capacity mode**: you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you expect
- Availability model:
