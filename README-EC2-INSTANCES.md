## Amazon EC2 Instances

Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for applications. Each instance type includes one or more instance sizes, allowing to scale the resources to the requirements of target workload.

### General Purpose
Instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads. These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.

### Compute Optimized
Instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. Instances belonging to this category are well suited for batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference and other compute intensive applications.

### Memory Optimized
Instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

### Accelerated Computing
Instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.

### Storage Optimized
Instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.

### High Performance Computing
Instances are purpose built to offer the best price performance for running HPC workloads at scale on AWS. HPC instances are ideal for applications that benefit from high-performance processors such as large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads.
